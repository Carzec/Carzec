ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Carzec, AKA Jonathan
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in electronics and using them to make cool things.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently at Washington and Lee University, studying engineering with computer science
âš¡ Fun fact: I've made some cool things including:
- 4x4x4 LED cube
- an EMG arm
- Modified non-addressable LEDs to work wirelessly on my phone (with a color wheel)
- Turned an old calculator into a spy calculator
Favorite hobby is definitely cooking.

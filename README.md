ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Carzec \n
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in electronics and using them to make cool things.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently at Washington and Lee University, studying engineering with computer science
âš¡ Fun fact: I've made some cool things including:
- 4x4x4 LED cube
- Mechanical arm that moves when detecting muscle signals
- Designed bluetooth controlled LED strip from old RGB light strip using Arduino Nano
- Turned an TI-30XIIS old calculator into a spy calculator to show heat signature on a keypad
- 30W audio amplifier with wireless on/off and volume control capabilities using
transmitter and receiver circuits using an ATMEGA328
